# Dermai_Skin_Disease_Classifier
Skin diseases can have serious health consequences if not diagnosed in time. The goal of this project is to classify images of skin lesions into seven categories using a deep convolutional neural network trained on the HAM10000 dataset.

Total Classes:

akiec (Actinic Keratoses)

bcc (Basal Cell Carcinoma)

bkl (Benign Keratosis)

df (Dermatofibroma)

mel (Melanoma)

nv (Melanocytic Nevi)

vasc (Vascular Lesions)
